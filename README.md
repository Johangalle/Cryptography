# Cryptography
Code snippets to learn cryptography without the need to use other libraries. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION

When you wish to install this, just do 
```
pip3 install cryptocourse
```

When you wish to uninstall this, just do 
```
pip3 uninstall cryptocourse
```

This github, in addition to the source code, contains some short code snippets to give you an idea how everything works. This material complements the cryptography course that I teach at Howest (https://www.howest.be).
