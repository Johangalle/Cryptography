# Cryptography
Code snippets to learn cryptography without the need to use other libraries. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION

When you wish to import these files, just copy all files from the code folder into an appropriate folder.

This file contains some short code snippets to give you an idea how everything works. This material complements the cryptography course that I teach at Howest (https://www.howest.be).
